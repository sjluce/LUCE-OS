# LUCE OS 🐧💡

**High-end AI-optimized Linux distribution for beast rigs**

LUCE OS is a truth-focused, performance-first Linux distro built for modern high-end hardware. No bloat, no telemetry—just raw power, maximum gaming performance, and intelligent hardware management.

## Vision
- **Truth over filters**: A system that respects your freedom and intelligence.
- **Built for power users**: Optimized for gaming, content creation, overclocking, and AI workloads.
- **Proactive intelligence**: AI-driven diagnostics, bottleneck detection, and optimization suggestions.
- **Zero compromise**: Bleeding-edge kernels, perfect driver support, and minimal overhead.

## Features (Planned & In Progress)
- Built-in hardware scanner with detailed reporting (CPU, GPU, drivers, temps, etc.)
- AI-powered analysis and recommendations (powered by Grok API or local models)
- Auto-optimization for gaming FPS, thermals, and power efficiency
- Voice/chat interface for system control ("LUCE, why is my GPU hot?")
- Custom high-performance kernel tweaks and gaming presets
- Clean, modern desktop experience tailored for high-refresh, high-res setups

## Current Status
**Early development – v0.1 in progress**

- Initial hardware scanner script added (Python-based, cross-platform compatible)
- Planning base distro (Arch or Fedora derivative for maximum performance)

## Roadmap
- v0.1: Core hardware scanner + basic AI integration
- v0.2: First live ISO with custom configs
- v0.3: Voice assistant and proactive monitoring
- v1.0: Full release for daily driving on high-end rigs

## Get Involved
- Star and watch the repo to follow progress 🚀
- Open issues for feature ideas or hardware you want supported
- Contributions welcome (scripts, docs, testing)
